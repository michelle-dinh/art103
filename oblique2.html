			<h3>Vector Illustrations (2018) | OUTSIDE WORKS</h3><br>
				<p>These a few iPhone compatible wallpapers I created using Adobe Illustrator. All wallpapers produced were made for personal use. Creating these helped sparked my passion for vectors and illustrations.</p><br>

			<h3>Feed Me Plz! (2018)</h3><br>
			<p>A collaborative project by William Chung, Emily Cheung, Ru Sia, and myself.</p><br>
				<p>Feed Me Plz is an interactive platform game where the player plays as a
				mama bird who needs to feed her hungry babies. The player navigates
				through four seasons in search for food. Beware! There are enemies and
				obstacles the player has to avoid, such as spikes and moving cats with nets.
				Unlock the next season by finding the hidden key in a special stage. The
				game emphasizes on the aspect of journey, time, and urgency.</p><br>

			<h3>Guess the Soda! (2018)</h3><br>
			<p>A team project by Emily Cheung and me.</p><br>
				<p>Emily and I decided to take a different direction and create a soda machine rather than stick to our initial prototype (the take-out box). In the prototype, we had a lot of extra inputs and outputs that were not necessary. It took up a lot of space and it did not clearly relay the idea of a take-out box nor looked like one. So, we upgraded both our enclosure and our software to create an interactive soda machine. We removed the motors and replaced it with air pumps, used two Neopixels instead of four LEDs, took out the circular soft pot, and made a mini guessing game with Processing. As a standalone, it can serve two beverages at a time.</p><br>

			<h3>Why it was interesting</h3><br>
				<p>I thought the whole process was interesting because we ended with a totally different project. Even though we had to tone down our ideas and functionalities to make it easier and less complicated, this project showed me that it was okay to not include everything and to only show the most important things.</p><br>
